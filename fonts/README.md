## Basics of font classification

A quick summary of the most import classification:
* **Serif fonts** have largely utilized with print (books, newspapers,...). A [serif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serif) is a small line attached to the end of a stroke in a letter or symbol. For fonts, the 'serf' line can be emellished in different ways to give it it's own unique look. Serif fonts are considered to more classical and elegant, and will talk to older audiences.

* **Sans serif fonts** are just that: fonts without serif lines attached. These are better suited for computer screens and smartphones. This is the reason why you'll primarily find the use of a sans serif font on most websites. Unsurprisingly, they are the dearest to the heart of the younger generations.

* **Script fonts** are modeled after 17th century handwriting styles. Like most font types, script has its own subsets, broken into formal and casual variants.
